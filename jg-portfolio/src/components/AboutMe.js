            <p>
                Greetings! I am a full-stack software engineering graduate from and based in Austin, Texas. I've been working as a technical drafting specialist for a local civil engineering firm for over 7 years and am looking to enter the software and web development industry.
            </p>
            <p>
                I've always excelled at contextualization and problem solving in my current line of work and in my education at General Assembly. When dealing with so many coding languages and an evolving industry, it is key to practice resourcefulness.  I believe these skills, coupled with my punctual and hark-working work ethic, will help me transfer into this exciting and relevant industry.
